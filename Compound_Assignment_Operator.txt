Compound Assignment Operators
There are also compound assignment operators that perform an operation and then assign the result back to the variable. Let's look at a few:

x -= 5        (Subtracts 5 from x and assigns the result back to x)
x *= 3        (Multiplies x by 3 and assigns the result back to x)
x /= 3        (Divides x by 3 and assigns the result back to x)
x %= 3        (Finds the remainder when x is divided by 3 and assigns the result back to x)
